### A quick script to annoy your friends or acquaintances
###### only tested on windows 11, should work on 10

These two files work in the background to launch an applicatioin (eg. chrome.exe) at a specificed interval. The aim of this to to launch in the background to be subtly annoying over a longer period (for example, launching chrome every 30 mins). It is nothing to be malicious but just annoying as people question why chrome is opening randomly. It is practically untraceable and will take someone with sufficent knowledge to end it.
